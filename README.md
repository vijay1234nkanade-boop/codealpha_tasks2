# 💳 Credit Score Prediction

This project predicts a person's **credit score category** (Good, Standard, or Poor) using **machine learning** based on their past financial data.

---

## 📘 Project Description

Credit scoring is an important task for banks and financial institutions.  
It helps in determining whether a customer is eligible for a loan or credit card based on their repayment behavior and financial history.

This project uses **Python and Machine Learning algorithms** to predict the credit score of a customer using input features such as:
- Annual Income  
- Loan Amount  
- Number of Bank Accounts  
- Number of Credit Cards  
- Delay from Due Date  
- Outstanding Debt  
- Monthly Balance  

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model Used

We have trained and compared multiple models:
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  

The **Random Forest Classifier** gave the best accuracy in our case.
